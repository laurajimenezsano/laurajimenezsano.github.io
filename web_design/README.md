# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

### Website Requirements

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The table must be a bootstrap table component. [Hint](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/tables/#responsive-tables)
    * The data must come from exporting the `.csv` file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a nifty method approprately called `to_html` that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe. See the documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_html.html)



Finally, the website must be deployed to GitHub pages.
When finished, submit to BootcampSpot the links to 1) the deployed app and 2) the GitHub repository.
Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file
